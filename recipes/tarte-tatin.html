  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Tarte Tatin is a french classic. With loads
    of butter and sugar that caramelise around the apples, it will satiate any craving for sweets!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>250g sugar</li>
      <li>100g butter</li>
      <li>6 apples</li>
      <li>1 puff pastry</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Peel and core the apples and cut them in half.</li>
      <li>In a cake pan that goes on the stove and in the oven, 
        place the sugar and the butter.</li>    
      <li>Place the apples on top of the sugar and butter,
        their convex side towards the bottom.</li>
      <li>Cover with the puff pastry, tucking the extra pastry inside the pan.</li>
      <li>Pierce small hole in the middle of the puff pastry
        to allow for the hot air to escape and the puff pastry to not bloat too much.</li>
      <li>Place on medium heat on the stove until the sugar and butter
        caramelise slightly (about 1/4h). Be careful not to let the caramel go too dark; check very regularly.</li>
      <li>Once the caramel is ready, place the pan in the oven preheated at 190 degrees Celsius for
        about 20 min.</li>
      <li>Once golden, remove from the oven, let it cool slightly and then flip onto serving plate.</li>
    </ol>
